"""Main Module for scarlett_os."""

# For the first problem, it is proposed that parentheses be permitted to enclose multiple
# names, thus allowing Python's standard mechanisms for multi-line values to apply.
# For the second problem, it is proposed that all import statements be absolute by default
# (searching sys.path only) with special syntax (leading dots) for accessing package-relative imports.

# I have a small question to the more python savvy people out there though. I have been trying to set a environment variable for Transmageddon in python, but so far it doesnâ€™t seem to work. If I in the shell do:
# export GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR= "/tmp"
# that works fine. But if I in my python code do
# os.environ["GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR"] = "/tmp"
# os.putenv('GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DIR_DIR', '/tmp')
# neither of them seem to have any effect. Anyone got a clue to what I am doing wrong?
# Edit: Turns out I was setting the environment variables to late in my file, I needed to do it before import gst was called :) Thanks Edward.
