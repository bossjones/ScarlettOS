# Experimental Code Style

**Note: This is just an idea at the moment, maybe we'll conform to it, maybe not**

```
Code Style

ScarlettOS's code follows the Google Python Style Guide. To automatically format your code, install YAPF:

$ pip install yapf
Then, either format a single file:

$ yapf --in-place FILE
Or, format all files in a directory:

$ yapf --in-place --recursive DIR
See the YAPF usage documentation for more information.
